## ✨Insights
This project demonstrates how SQL can be leveraged to clean, transform, and analyze raw transactional data, uncovering patterns in sales performance, customer preferences, and revenue trends. By applying techniques such as joins, aggregations and window functions, complex queries are simplified into meaningful insights. Furthermore, Tableau Public visualizations translate these insights into intuitive, interactive dashboards that highlight key business metrics such as top-selling pizzas, category-wise revenue contribution, time-based order distribution, and cumulative growth. Together, SQL and Tableau showcase the power of combining data analysis with visualization to drive data-informed decision-making in the food industry.
